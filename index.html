            <p>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma – which is
                living with the results of other people's thinking. -Steve Jobs</p>

            <h2>Become a Web Developer</h2>
            <p>I will like to talk about my dream if I could say. My dream is to become a computer programmer because I
                think it’s cool and meaningful and requires logic thinking. Not just that, but also to be able to help
                make the lives of people easily and simple. You might be wondering why I’m saying this, as we all know,
                we are in the Computer Age and 90% of your daily activities requires the use of technologies. And we all
                know machines are here to stay and to make our lives easily.</p>
